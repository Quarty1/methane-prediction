## Todo
- Planning & Design
  - Choose behaviors used in model (eating, ruminating, resting)
  - Define full pipeline (YOLO → behavior → IPCC → methane)
  - Decide camera angle (side view)

- Dataset & Preparation
  - Select cow behavior dataset
  - Download dataset (CBVD-5 Cow Behavior Video Dataset)
  - Convert dataset to YOLO format
  - Split dataset into train/validation/test

- YOLO Behavior Model
  - Train YOLO behavior detection model on Kaggle
  - Detect cows and behavior classes
  - Save trained model weights
  - Evaluate model (mAP, precision, recall)

- Inference & Feature Extraction
  - Run YOLO inference on cow videos
  - Extract behavior duration (eating, rumination, resting)
  - Save extracted features to CSV

- Feature Processing
  - Remove short false detections
  - Smooth behavior time series
  - Validate behavior ranges using literature

- Methane Modeling (IPCC)
  - Study IPCC Tier 2 methane model
  - Implement IPCC methane equation in Python
  - Test methane calculation with sample values

- Behavior to Methane Variables
  - Estimate Dry Matter Intake (DMI) from eating time
  - Estimate methane conversion factor (Ym) from rumination
  - Define literature-based parameter ranges

- Final Methane Prediction
  - Combine behavior, DMI, and Ym into IPCC model
  - Calculate methane per cow (g/day)
  - Calculate total farm methane emission

- Accuracy & Validation
  - Compare predictions with IPCC default values
  - Compare predictions with published methane ranges
  - Estimate final system accuracy

- Sensitivity Testing
  - Increase eating time and verify methane increases
  - Improve feed efficiency and verify methane decreases
  - Check biological consistency

- Presentation & Demo
  - Create system architecture diagram
  - Record YOLO behavior detection demo
  - Prepare presentation slides
